# Predicting Health Risks, Stay Healthy, Stay Ahead!

# Datasets:
2011-2015 Dataset: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Dataset (2011-2015)
2023 Dataset: 2023 Dataset

# Steps
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and standardize lifestyle-related variables.
EDA: Explore correlations between lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, exercise) and health outcomes (e.g., diabetes, heart disease).
Feature Engineering: Create aggregated health indices, lifestyle scores, and demographic profiles.
Modeling:
Implement logistic regression and kNN classification to predict health risks.
Use tree-based models to understand the impact of various lifestyle factors.
Evaluation: Use metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for model evaluation.
Insights: Identify key lifestyle factors associated with health risks and suggest preventive measures.
