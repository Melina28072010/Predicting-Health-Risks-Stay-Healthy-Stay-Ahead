# Predicting Health Risks, Stay Healthy, Stay Ahead!

# Datasets:
• 2011-2015 Dataset: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 
• Dataset (2011-2015)
• 2023 Dataset: 2023 Dataset

# Steps
• Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and standardize lifestyle-related variables.
• EDA: Explore correlations between lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, exercise) and health outcomes (e.g., diabetes, heart disease).
• Feature Engineering: Create aggregated health indices, lifestyle scores, and demographic profiles.
• Modeling:
• Implement logistic regression and kNN classification to predict health risks.
• Use tree-based models to understand the impact of various lifestyle factors.
• Evaluation: Use metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for model evaluation.
• Insights: Identify key lifestyle factors associated with health risks and suggest preventive measures.

# Milestone 1
This was a document including our core problem and how we were initially going to solve it.
Basically, the document was 2 pages of methodology (the steps included above), our dataset and how we were planning to evaluate it
and the core problem statement "Health issues like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity are on a rise, 
and understanding how life choices impact these conditions are more important than ever."

# Milestone 2
In this milestone, we managed to bind a PowerPoint explaining each step above individually and how we are planning to use them to solve our problem.
Furthermore, our innovation was added and why we picked this problem statement initially as we were confident that tackling this problem was possible.
As we're both extremely interested in medicine we thought that this would be the ideal project to work on and that would stimulate our ability to work
more efficiently as a group.

# Milestone 3
Milestone 3.1: In this part of our project we managed to create a Google colab notebook including our dataset cleaned and we managed to visualize it in different forms
(bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots). We basically encountered what we're dealing with and what we will take into account (e.g it's classification
or a regression problem).

Milestone 3.2: Here we presented an elongated Powerpoint explaining our problem once again. Also, our data analysis from milestone 3.1 and what we've learned from it with advantages added on every visualization. Last of all, our adjustments that we've made until this point.
